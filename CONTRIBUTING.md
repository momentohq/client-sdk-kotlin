# Development

Requires the android sdk installed and the ANDROID_HOME environment variable set:
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/{user}/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```
## Testing
### Intellij
Android instrumented tests can be run by running them through IntelliJ with the Android plugin or Android Studio.
The `TEST_API_KEY` must be set in your `.zshrc` or somewhere else IntelliJ can read it when it executes the gradle project. The tests cannot directly read environment variables from the host machine, so `TEST_API_KEY` is read by the gradle project and stored in a test property.

### Command Line
Android instrumented tests can be run from the command line by first starting an emulator:
```bash
emulator -list-avds # list available emulators
emulator -avd {one of the listed emulators} # start the emulator
```
Then run the tests:
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
`TEST_API_KEY` must be set for the tests to work.
